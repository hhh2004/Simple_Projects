# Guess the Number

A very simple console-based game made by me in Python.

Your job in the game is to guess a random number between 1 and 100 generated by the computer in a limited number of tries. After each try, the computer tells you if your guess is higher, lower or equal to the random number. If you guess correctly, you win. Otherwise, if you run out of tries, you lose.
